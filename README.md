# Bootleg Packages

This repository contains a collection of Dockerfiles that are used to build packages for things that Caketop would like to have packages of.

Builds of these packages are available on [Packagecloud](https://packagecloud.io/caketop/bootleg-packages).

## Maintenence

This repository is provided to the public in the spirit of sharing; however, we make no commitment with regard to maintenence of these packages. These packages are built to serve the needs and whims of Caketop. You are welcome to use them, but any value you may derive from them outside of the needs and whims of Caketop is accidental. If you find something here that you consider absolutely essential, you should be prepared to fork this repository and maintain it yourself.

## Contributing

You may open pull requests against this repository, but depending on the nature of the pull request, you may find that your contributions are unwelcome. This is not a community repository; the packages here are specifically built to meet the needs of Caketop. Fixes for bugs and operational problems will be gratefully accepted, but anything else is likely to be turned away. You are always welcome to fork this repository and build your own packages based on it, though.
