# Bootleg Packages

This repository contains a collection of Dockerfiles that are used to build packages for things that Caketop would like to have packages of.

Builds of these packages are available on [Packagecloud](https://packagecloud.io/caketop/bootleg-packages).

## ⚠️ Warning ⚠️

The way packages are built here is very dirty; if you care about packaging, it's almost heartbreaking. Absolutely nothing in this repository should be construted as best practices or something to be emulated.

The packages work, though, and they have proper shared library dependencies :)

## Maintenence

This repository is provided to the public in the spirit of sharing; however, there is no commitment with regard to maintenence of these packages outside of their use at Caketop. You are welcome to use them, but any value you may derive from them outside of the needs and whims of Caketop is accidental. If you find a package here that you consider essential, you should be aware that it may be dropped from this repository with no warning, or changed in a way that is no longer useful to you. If you really like something here and want to keep it forever, you should be prepared to fork this repository and maintain it yourself.

## Contributing

You may open pull requests against this repository, but you may find that your contributions are unwelcome. This is not a community repository; the packages here are specifically built to meet the needs of Caketop. Fixes for bugs and operational problems will be gratefully accepted, but anything else is likely to be turned away. Please don't take it personally if your pull request is rejected.
