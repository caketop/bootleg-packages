# msmtp

This is a backport of a newer version of [msmtp][https://marlam.de/msmtp/] to Ubuntu 20.04.

The sources are taken from a Debian snapshot of sid.

This exists because the `msmtp` in 20.04 is old and feature-deficient.

It is available in the [bootleg packages apt repository](https://packagecloud.io/caketop/bootleg-packages) as `msmtp` - it upgrades/replaces the `mstmp` that comes with 20.04.
