# PyGObject

This is [PyGObject](https://pypi.org/project/PyGObject/), built for [Caketop's Python](../python/).

This is currently built on Ubuntu 20.04 using sources from PyPI.

It is available in the [bootleg packages apt repository](https://packagecloud.io/caketop/bootleg-packages) as `optpython3.10-gi` - it is named that way to be consistent with Ubuntu's package, which is named `python3-gi`.
